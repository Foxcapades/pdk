   * any 'tail' data will be put inline after the head data.
   *
   * Example
   * ```
   * newCap   = 8
   * previous = [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]
   * new      = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 0]

   *
   * This method does not check to see if the resize is necessary ahead of time
   * as it is only called when the necessity of a resize has already been
   * confirmed.
