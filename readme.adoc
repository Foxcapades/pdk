Simple library that provides Deque implementations for all Kotlin's primitive
types that deal in unboxed values.

== Usage

.`*build.gradle.kts*`
[source, kotlin]
----
dependencies {
  implementation("io.foxcapades.lib:pdk:1.2.0")
}
----

=== Examples

.*Reading Longs from a Stream*
--
[source, kotlin]
----
val deque = ByteDeque(8192)
val read  = deque.fillFrom(inputStream)

for (i in 0 until read step 8)
  println(deque.popLong())
----

NOTE: This is just an example, the JDK's builtin type `ByteBuffer` is able to
read long values from a stream up to 50% faster than `ByteDeque` due to
`ByteBuffer` utilizing the `Unsafe` class to raw cast bytes in memory as a long
value.

=== Method & Property Aliases

Similar to the JDK's `Queue` type and various implementations, the `*Deque`
types have multiple aliases for most properties and methods that align with
different use cases or implementations from different languages.  Each alias is
an inline method or property allowing library users to choose the specific
syntax they prefer without any call-stack overhead.  This is particularly useful
when porting libraries or code from other languages such as C++ into Kotlin.

The head and tail of the deque are named just that, "head", and "tail", however
they are also accessible via "front", "first", "back", and "last" for most
properties and methods, for example, the property `head`, which is handle on the
first element in the deque, has the alias properties `first` and `front`,
similarly the method `pushHead`, which pushes an element onto the head of the
deque, has the alias methods `pushFirst` and `pushFront`.

* link:{srcDir}/UShortDeque.kt[`UShortDeque`]
* link:{srcDir}/UIntDeque.kt[`UIntDeque`]
* link:{srcDir}/ULongDeque.kt[`ULongDeque`]

== Footprint

`pdk` aims to be as lightweight as possible both in terms of memory and compute
footprint.  All of the `PrimitiveDeque` implementations wrap 3 properties, a
primitive array of a specified capacity, an `int` value recording the current
size of the deque, and one more `int` value tracking the internal 'head'
position in the deque's backing array.

Additionally, in all situations where it is possible, copy operations are
performed by the native `arrayCopy` method.

Presently the only situation where `arrayCopy` is not used on copy is when
copying the contents of a `Collection` instance into a deque.

=== Dependencies

`pdk` only depends on the Kotlin and JDK standard library.
